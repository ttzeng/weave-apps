## Android Weave companion app for the Brillo MP3 jukebox demo
This folder contains the Android source code of the Weave companion app for the [Brillo MP3 jukebox demo](https://github.com/ttzeng/brillo-products/tree/master/Examples/demo). Google addresses the interoperability problem of IoT devices by introducing a device representation model based on a set of standard [trait schemas](https://developers.google.com/weave/guides/overview/schemas-and-interop#what_are_weave_schemas) which contain the command and state definitions for common device capabilities and hehavior, client apps then interact with devices using the trait definition to understand the capabilities of the devices. This Weave companion app supports Android [Card views](https://developer.android.com/training/material/lists-cards.html#CardView) for standard [onOff](https://developers.google.com/weave/v1/reference/device-api/onOff), [volume](https://developers.google.com/weave/v1/reference/device-api/volume) trait schemas, and a proprietary _mediaplayer custom trait for MP3 playback.
